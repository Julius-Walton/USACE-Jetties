# Visualizing Vessel Traffic Near Costal Structures

## Purpose
This project was created for the USACE to help understand data about vessel traffic near costal structures across the US. This project is currently hosted on Google Cloud Services at the following link https://strange-tome-305601.ue.r.appspot.com/

## Directions
When the website is loaded points on the map will be displayed representing various costal structures throughout the US. The map can be navigated by dragging and zooming. Different points can be clicked to view basic information about the structure located at that position. From the basic information panel different distribution graphs can be acessed for each point.
